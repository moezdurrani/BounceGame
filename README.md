Seeking entertainment during the summer holidays, I found myself captivated by a particular game that ignited my imagination. Inspired by its appeal, I envisioned the possibility of creating a similar game myself. I reached out to a like-minded friend and proposed the idea of collaborating on this endeavor. Enthusiastically, she embraced the opportunity, and together, leveraging our skills in C Programming language, we brought our vision to life.
