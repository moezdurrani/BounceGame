# bounce_game
During summer holidays, I got really bored when I was at home. So I downloaded a game and started playing it. I really liked the game. That is why this idea came in my mind that why shouldn't I make this game myself. So I contacted another friend of mine and asked her if she wants to make this game together. She agreed and we made this game in C Programming language
